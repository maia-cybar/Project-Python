Pre-processed data
The folder contains the following 
1.	Python codes to hydrate data using tweet Ids and Twython library. The data obtained from Twitter API contains a lot of information that is not suitable for this 
project, so I only extracted Full tweet texts, kept tweet Ids, and saved them in CSV file or text file. 
In some instances the data obtained was encoded utf-16le, I changed the encoding to utf_8 using open source such as Convert text files to unicode UTF-8"easy encoding fix | Subtitle Tools".
2.	Python code to extract data from GitHub API. I have three version of this code as I faced a few challenges in every code,
 so it was necessary to update and improve the code to increase data collection.
3.	The python code used to extract programming codes from “John Burkardt's Home Page (fsu.edu)” site.

They were a lot of intermediate steps before we got the clean data. I have included samples of the tweet Ids used and the outcome text or CSV files.
